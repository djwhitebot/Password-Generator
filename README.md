# <Random Password Generator>

## Description



I was given the following parameters for building a random password generator:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

 This project was a great way to apply the various Javascript concepts we've learned so far in our bootcamp. 
Building something is the best way to take class concepts and see their application in realtime. I used "console.log()" to check whether or not my code behaved in the expected way. 




## Usage

This is a quick and easy way to generate a random password for any account. Feel free to play around with the valuesin the arrays if you'd like different potential outputs for your password.
